# MongoDB Aggregation Error: Unexpected Results

This repository demonstrates a common error in MongoDB aggregation pipelines that leads to unexpected results. The error stems from an incorrectly constructed `$match` stage using regular expressions, coupled with a `$group` stage that produces inaccurate counts.

## Bug Description

The provided JavaScript code snippet shows an aggregation pipeline. The intention is to count documents matching a specific pattern in a field called `fieldName`. However, the regular expression in the `$match` stage might be incorrect, or the `$group` stage might not be aggregating the data as expected.

## Bug Solution

The solution involves carefully reviewing the regular expression used in the `$match` stage and ensuring its correctness. Additionally, it's crucial to verify that the `$group` stage correctly aggregates the data based on the desired criteria.

## How to Reproduce

1. Create a MongoDB collection with a field called `fieldName`.
2. Insert sample documents with varying values in `fieldName`.
3. Execute the aggregation pipeline provided in `bug.js`.
4. Compare the results with the expected output.

## Solution

The solution is provided in `bugSolution.js`, which demonstrates the corrected aggregation pipeline.
